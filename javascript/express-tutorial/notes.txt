Express is a fast, minimalist web framework for Node
Runs on the server

Makes building Node web apps much easier
Used for both server rendered apps as well as APIs/microservices
Light, fast, and free
Full control of request and response
By far the most popular Node framework
Great to use with client side frameworks so it's all JS

Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects
Middleware is capable of executing any code, making changes to req/res objects, end response cycle, etc.
