What's Node?
Node is JS runtime.
JS on the server

Stuff you should know:
- JS fundies: OOP, Arrays, Conditionals
- HTTP
- JSON
- ES6: arrow functions, promises, MVC pattern

Why Node?
Fast, efficient, highly scalable
Event driver, non-blocking I/O model
Full-stack language

Node runs on a single-thread, so if a process is synchronous it would block the thread
Supports concurrency via events and callbacks
Node is good for anything that isn't CPU intensive
Good for REST APIs, microservices, CRUD apps, realtime services (chat, live updates)
Node and MongoDB make a very good team

npm init            Generates a package.json file
npm i express       Installs a package locally in app folder
npm i -g nodemon    Installs a package globally on your system

Node core modules (path, fs, http, etc.)
const path = require('path')
